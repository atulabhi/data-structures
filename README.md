# Introduction

This repository is a data structure tutorial based on Golang. Data structures are very cool and exciting way to learn programming. Although concepts of data structures are agnostic to programming languages but practising data structures on a language can help gain more grasp and confidence on the particular language.

# Prerequiste
This is a beginner friendly tutorial and does not require any prior experience and knowledge of data structures but knowledge of basic programming in Golang is a prerequisite.
If you are new to golang or just getting started with programming, I would recommend completing following Go tour.
