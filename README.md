# Introduction

This repository is a data structure tutorial based on Golang. Data structures are very cool and exciting way to learn programming. Although concepts of data structures are agnostic to programming languages but practising data structures on a language can help gain more grasp and confidence on the particular language.

# Prerequiste
This is a beginner friendly tutorial and does not require any prior experience and knowledge of data structures but knowledge of basic programming in Golang is a prerequisite.
If you are new to golang or just getting started with programming, I would recommend completing following Go tour.

# Target Audience

This tutorial is for you if :
- You are learning programming and want to get a sound understanding of data structures. 
- You are familiar and comfortable in programming and preparing for coding interview.
- You have sound understanding of data structure but before going to an interview you just want to refresh the concepts.
 
This tutorial is NOT for you if :
- You are an expert in data structure and want to do more advanced research or study on it.
